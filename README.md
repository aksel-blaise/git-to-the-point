# Git-to-the-Point: Learn Git and Contribute to Texas Archaeology

Contributors: Robert Z. Selden, Jr.; Juanita D. Garcia; and David Foxe

Diagnostic artifacts comprise the basis for archaeological interpretations; however, as our taxonomic definitions evolve, artifacts that were previously assigned to a type generally retain that designation, potentially confounding future research efforts and interpretations. For this exercise, the original type assignments are made available in an editable format that fosters engagement with the basic principles of open science and reproducibility. Through the enlistment of Git, GitHub, and an open call to revise projectile point types&mdash;and their associated attributes&mdash;for specimens found across the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (NFGT), the current catalog of projectile points and their most recent type assignments and attributes are made available to a general audience. This approach holds promise for historical and archaeological collections throughout a variety of research domains, and as a snowy/rainy-day option for outdoor outreach and citizen-science projects.
