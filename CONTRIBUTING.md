# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

* Make sure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free). Users that are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub can either work through the Git-it challenges to get started in the command line (http://jlord.us/git-it/) or review the content at http://happygitwithr.com/ to get started in R.
* Upon identifying where you can make a contribution to one or more of the entries, [submit a post for your issue](https://github.com/aksel-blaise/git-to-the-point/issues), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Be sure to clearly describe your issue, and include a link to the PDF form(s) or file(s) in question.
  * Make note of the issue number, and include it in the title of your Pull Request (i.e., `Fix for Issue c0a95e3`).

## Making changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub to make a copy of the repository on your account, or use `git clone git@github.com:your-username/git-to-the-point.git` in your shell terminal.
* Typological assignments should follow the most recently-published type book for the region (Turner et al. 2011), and additional comments can be entered at the bottom of each form.
* Commits should be made following modification of each file, and should include the filename (i.e., `git commit -m "<edit 01SB102-3-Point1_>"`.
* Edit the readme.md file, and add your name at the end of the list of contributors. Remember to make this a separate commit (i.e., `git commit -m "<edit readme>"`).
* Before submitting a Pull Request to add your changes to the repository, be sure that you have reviewed all proposed changes, and include the issue number that your Pull Request resolves.

## Discoveries, new and old

When a new projectile point is discovered on the lands of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas, it will be added to this list. We are also open to collaboration with collectors and their descendants who may wish to add one or more specimens to this inventory. Use the _Watch_ feature at the top right of the GitHub repository to be alerted when new points are added, or changes are made.
