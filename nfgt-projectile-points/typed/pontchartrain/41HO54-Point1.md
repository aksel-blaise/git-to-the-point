# 41HO54-Point1

The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from 41HO54 indicate that the site was occupied during the Late Paleoindian, Late Archaic, and ancestral Caddo periods. The one Late Paleoindian point from the site is a reworked [San Patrice _var. Hope_ point](../san-patrice/41HO54-Point2.md) made from a non-local bluish-gray chert. The Late Archaic use of the site is marked by this well-made Pontchartrain dart point of yellowish-brown chert; a yellowish-brown biface fragment is probably also part of this component. Finally, there is a post-A.D. 800 Caddo component at this site identified by the presence of two plain grog-tempered body sherds.
