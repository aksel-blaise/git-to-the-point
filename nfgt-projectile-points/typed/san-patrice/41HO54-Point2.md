# 41HO54-Point2

The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from 41HO54 indicate that the site was occupied during the Late Paleoindian, Late Archaic, and ancestral Caddo periods. The one Late Paleoindian point from the site is this reworked San Patrice _var. Hope_ made from a non-local bluish-gray chert. The Late Archaic use of the site is marked by a well-made [Pontchartrain dart point](../pontchartrain/41HO54-Point1.md) of yellowish-brown chert; a yellowish-brown biface fragment is probably also part of this component. Finally, there is a post-A.D. 800 Caddo component at this site identified by the presence of two plain grog-tempered body sherds.
